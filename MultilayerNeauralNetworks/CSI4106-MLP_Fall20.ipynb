    "We are going into the medical domain for this notebook. The supervised classification task tackled in this notebook is about diabetes patient readmission to a hospital, provided a certain set of features describing their physical state, the procedure they went through during their stay, the medications they take, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any *readmitted patient* is very costly for a medical system. It shows to some extent, that the patient was discharged before having fully recovered. The dataset we explore splits readmission into 3 values: before 30 days, after 30 days, and none.  Understanding what conditions brings patients back to the hospital within 30 days is very important for a medical system, as these cases should be minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will allow you to pursue your understanding of experimental set-up for supervised machine learning, in particular supervised classification through the use of multi-layer perceptrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make use of three packages: (1) **scikit-learn**, a great machine learning package, which you've experimented with in the last notebook, (2) **pandas**, a must-have for data science, and (3) **matplotlib** which is a great plotting library (pip install matplotlib).  Make sure you have the LATEST version of scikit-learn (at least version >= 0.20), otherwise some functions (the one-hot-encoder) will not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is your 6th notebook this semester, some instructions will be a bit less explicit and may require looking at some online official documentation. If you have any assumptions state them and think about how to handle the questions."

    "Unzip the file *dataset_diabetes.zip* and there should be a file called *diabetic_data.csv* which we will use for our experiments. The file must be located at *dataset_diabetes/diabetic_data.csv* from the same directory as this notebook."

    "We will use the package *pandas* to read the csv file. Pandas will create a data structure called a dataframe, which will contain all the data. Dataframes are a crucial data structure that allows makes it very easy to analyze the data that you are working with, retrieve subsets of the data based on search conditions, and utilize the data in Machine Learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get some errors when you import the packages, it's because they are not installed... make sure you do *pip install package_name* (or whichever method you have been using to install the packages) at the command prompt to have access to these packages."
